Overview
This system is designed for a local hospice charity that operates four physical charity shops. The primary objective is to allow each shop to showcase the unique items they have in stock, without integrating with the existing ecommerce operation. The system provides a user-friendly platform for volunteers to manage inventory, while also giving the public a way to browse items currently available in stores.
