                        Engaging in regular physical activity is essential for maintaining good physical health,
                        reducing the risk of chronic diseases, improving mood, and promoting overall well-being.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Balanced diet:
                    <p>
                        Eating a balanced and nutritious diet that includes a variety of fruits, vegetables, whole
                        grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats can provide the essential nutrients needed for good
                        health.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Adequate sleep:
                    <p>
                        Getting enough quality sleep is important for overall health and well-being. Adults should aim
                        for 7-9 hours of sleep each night.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Stress management:
                    <p>
                        Finding healthy ways to manage stress, such as practicing mindfulness or meditation, can help
                        reduce the negative effects of stress on physical and mental health.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Avoiding harmful behaviors:
                    <p>
                        Avoiding harmful behaviors such as smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, and drug use is
                        essential for maintaining good health and reducing the risk of chronic diseases.


                    </p>

                <li>
                    Social support:
                    <p>
                        Building and maintaining strong relationships with friends and family can provide emotional
                        support and improve overall well-being.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>

            </p>

            <h2>Importance</h2>
            <p id="mental_health">Maintaining a healthy lifestyle is important for a number of reasons. Firstly, a
                healthy lifestyle can
                help prevent chronic diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, and certain cancers. Engaging in regular
                physical activity, eating a balanced diet, and avoiding harmful behaviors such as smoking and excessive
                alcohol consumption can reduce the risk of developing these and other health conditions. Additionally, a
                healthy lifestyle can improve mental health and well-being. Regular exercise, adequate sleep, and stress
                management can all help reduce the negative effects of stress and improve mood. Good nutrition can also
                have a positive impact on mental health by providing essential nutrients for brain function. Overall, a
                healthy lifestyle can improve quality of life and increase lifespan. By adopting healthy habits and
                behaviors, individuals can enjoy more energy, better physical and mental health, and a greater sense of
                well-being.

            <h2>What is mental health?</h2>
            <p>Mental health refers to an individual's overall psychological well-being, including their emotional,
                social, and cognitive functioning. It encompasses the way we think, feel, and behave in response to
                life's challenges, stressors, and opportunities. Mental health includes the ability to cope with stress,
                maintain healthy relationships, and make meaningful contributions to society. It also involves having a
                positive self-image, a sense of purpose and meaning in life, and the ability to adapt to change and
                uncertainty. Good mental health is an essential component of overall health and well-being, and it is
                important to prioritize self-care and seek professional help when needed to maintain and improve mental
                health.

            <h1>BMI Calculator</h1>

            <h2>How to use it?</h2>
            <p>
                The purpose of a BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator is to provide an indication of whether someone's
                weight is healthy in relation to their height. BMI is a measurement of body fat based on a person's
                weight and height, and it's commonly used as an assessment tool to screen for weight categories that may
                lead to health problems.<br><br>

                BMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight in kilograms by their height in meters squared (BMI =
                kg/mÂ²). The resulting number is then used to categorize individuals into different weight categories:

            <ul class="list">
                <li>
                    BMI less than 18.5 - Underweight

                </li>
                <li>
                    BMI between 18.5 and 24.9 - Normal weight

                </li>
                <li>
                    BMI between 25 and 29.9 - Overweight

                </li>
                <li>
                    BMI over 30 - Obese

                </li>

            </ul>

            BMI is not a perfect measurement of body fat, and it has some limitations. For example, it does not take
            into account the difference between muscle mass and fat, which can be an issue for athletes or
            bodybuilders. Additionally, other factors such as age, gender, and ethnicity may also influence BMI.
